A long side this instance tracker, we have a webring! This webring is managed by [hyperdefined](https://hyper.lol). The badges were created by [lostdusty](https://github.com/lostdusty). You can see it in action at the bottom of this site!

### How can I join?
You can join via the [cobalt discord](https://discord.gg/pQPt8HBUPu). Currently, we only accept trusted members of the community.

### What do I need to add to my site?
You need to add the script tag, which handles loading & displaying the ring. The `<div>` tag is simply where you want it to display.
```html
<div id="cobaltWebring"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ site.url }}/assets/js/webring.js"></script>
```

### Can I customize it?
Yes, you can change how it looks with regular CSS.
